## Project Background
Information about diseases for farmers on their livestock are needed, especially for farmers who live far from town or in a rural area which are far away from vets and that would be a challenge for them if their livestock get diseases and they don’t know or are not aware of diseases due to lack of knowledge or limitations on technology they use as a result, the health of the animals is also a concern, and also leading to lower productivity and profitability for the farmers. 

Our goal in building this application is to assist farmers where they have access to a user-friendly application that can help them identify diseases. The app will improve the health of the animals and ultimately increase the farmers' productivity and profitability.
